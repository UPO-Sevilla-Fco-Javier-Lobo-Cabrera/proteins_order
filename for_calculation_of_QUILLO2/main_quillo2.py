#This script receives as parameter the path to
#the pdb_entry_type.txt file and proceeds as follows:
#0)Creates an output file named pdb_and_obtained_quillo2.txt.
#1)Reads a line (starting with the first) of the pdb_entry_type.txt file.
#2)If the line is that corresponding to a protein --i.e if the line
#contains the word "prot"-- then the pdb code contained in that line
#is downloaded from the RCSB database.
#3)The obtain_quillo2 function from
#calculate_quillo2.py if invoked with a try()
#statement, passing as argunment the route of the downloaded pdb file.
#4)If the obtain_quillo2 function works, then the pdb code
#and the corresponding QUILLO2 value are appended to 
#pdb_and_obtained_quillo2.txt .
#5)Proceed in the same manner with the rest of lines of the
#pdb_entry_type.txt file.
