Each directory contains the code to calculate each parameter: a)QUILLO, b)QUILLO2, c)other parameters (compactness, system temperature, surface area per residue, secondary structure composition).
Addittionally, there is code available for the calculation of deviations from expected values.

Finally, casp12_testing contains the tools for the analysis of casp12 rankings according to their deviations from proportion expected values.
